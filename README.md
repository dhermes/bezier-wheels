> **Note**
> This was previously used to build wheels [`bezier`][1]. As of 2023-07-28,
> this is no longer necessary because the `bezier` project has switched
> to [`cibuildwheel`][2]. See the **Building Wheels** [workflow][3] in the
> `bezier` repository for the new/current process for building wheels.
